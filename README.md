# Movie-Classification-by-Clustering-Insights-from-IMDb-Ratings-and-Genres
# Overview

This project focuses on clustering movies based on various attributes such as genre, ratings, and gross revenue. The goal is to group movies into clusters that exhibit similar characteristics, which can help in understanding patterns and trends in movie data. Clustering movies can provide insights into the types of movies that are similar to each other and identify underlying patterns that might not be apparent from individual features alone. By using clustering techniques, this project aims to uncover meaningful groupings and characteristics within the movie industry.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about movies from IMDb. Key columns in the dataset include: Movie Name: Title of the movie

Release Year: The year the movie was released

Duration: Duration of the movie in minutes

IMDB Rating: Rating of the movie on IMDb

Metascore: Metascore rating of the movie

Votes: Number of votes the movie has received

Genre: Genre(s) of the movie

Director: Director(s) of the movie

Cast: Main cast members of the movie

Gross: Gross revenue of the movie

## Installation

# Install Jupyter Notebook: 
Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

Install Required Packages: Install the necessary Python packages using your preferred method (e.g., via Anaconda, or directly using pip). The key packages needed for this project include:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly.express

These packages are essential for data analysis, visualization, and clustering.

# Procedure

1.Load the Libraries.

2.Load the dataset from a CSV file.

3.Summarization of Data to Understand Dataset (Descriptive Statistics)

4.Remove null values and unnecessary columns.

5.Replace special symbols and convert the columns into necessary data types.

6.Applying Clustering Algorithms: Using techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.

7.Cluster Analysis: Analyzing the characteristics of each cluster to interpret the results.

8.Visualization of Clusters using plotly.express: Visualizing clusters to understand the grouping of movies.

# Usage

Download the Dataset: Obtain the IMDb dataset.

Run the Analysis: Follow the project steps to explore the data, preprocess it, apply clustering algorithms, and analyze the resulting clusters.

Review Results: Examine the clusters to understand the grouping patterns and characteristics.

# Results

The clustering analysis revealed distinct groups of movies based on their attributes. For instance, movies in the same cluster often shared similar genres, ratings, and revenue ranges. The K-Means algorithm, when applied with a suitable number of clusters, provided meaningful groupings that reflect the underlying structure in the movie dataset. These clusters can help in understanding market trends and preferences, as well as in making recommendations based on similar movie characteristics.
